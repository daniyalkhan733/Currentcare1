#### **1. No Power:**
   - **Issue:** TV does not turn on.
   - **Solution:** Check power connections, try a different power outlet, ensure the remote or power button on the TV is functioning, and inspect for any visible damage to the power cord.

#### **2. No Picture, Only Sound:**
   - **Issue:** You can hear sound but there's no picture.
   - **Solution:** Check the input source (cable, HDMI, etc.), inspect the cables for damage, test different input sources, and ensure the TV is on the correct input mode.

#### **3. Distorted or No Sound:**
   - **Issue:** Sound is fuzzy, distorted, or absent.
   - **Solution:** Check audio settings on both the TV and the source device, test different audio outputs (internal speakers, external speakers), and ensure mute is not enabled.

#### **4. Flickering or Pixelated Picture:**
   - **Issue:** Picture quality is poor, flickering, or pixelated.
   - **Solution:** Check the cable or satellite connection, replace damaged cables, ensure a stable internet connection for smart TVs, and adjust display settings (resolution, refresh rate) on both the TV and connected devices.

#### **5. Remote Control Problems:**
   - **Issue:** Remote control doesn’t work or works intermittently.
   - **Solution:** Replace remote batteries, clean the remote’s infrared sensor, check for obstructions between the remote and the TV, and if possible, test with a universal remote to rule out a faulty remote.

#### **6. TV Freezes or Takes a Long Time to Respond:**
   - **Issue:** TV becomes unresponsive or freezes during operation.
   - **Solution:** Check for software updates, clear cache and temporary files, perform a factory reset (only if necessary, as this will erase settings), and limit the number of background apps running (for smart TVs).
